## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to show the accumulation of knowledge we have gained throughout the semester into one place that can showcase all of them. I've personally enjoyed the journey of building the website bit by bit until the layers come together to create a beautiful piece of work.

## Description of Skills Learned  

Throughout the development of this website, I gained valuable experience and technical proficiency in several areas, including:  

- **HTML Notation and Syntax**:  
  Learning the structure and proper use of tags, elements, and attributes to create well-formed HTML documents.

- **Displaying Information with HTML**:  
  Effectively organizing and presenting content using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images.

- **Gathering Information through HTML**:  
  Understanding form elements and how to collect user input using text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and radio inputs.

- **Styling with CSS**:  
  Applying styles to text, layout, and design elements using selectors, classes, and IDs to create visually appealing pages.

- **Accessibility Solutions**:  
  Implementing techniques to make the website more accessible, such as using semantic HTML, proper labeling, and focus management for screen readers.

- **Fair Use and Ethical Practices**:  
  Ensuring compliance with copyright laws and ethical standards, such as crediting sources and using licensed assets responsibly.

- **CSS Animation**:
  CSS animation allows you to create smooth transitions and movements on web elements without using JavaScript. By defining keyframes and properties like duration, timing, and easing, you can bring your website to life with effects like fading, sliding, or rotating.

- **Nav Bar**:
  Created a Hamburger Icon for Mobile Users. I also added a cool animation where the hamburger icon animates itself into an 'X' when selected, then returns back to normal when unchecked.
